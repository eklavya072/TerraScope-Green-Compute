"""Every headline number in the README, re-derived from summary.json.

This exists because a hand-typed README sentence once claimed MobileNetV3-Small
at 4 threads was "2.2x faster but ~47% MORE energy" when the measured values are
1.50x and 16% LESS -- wrong in magnitude AND direction. It was stale from a
smoke test taken before an energy bug was fixed, and it survived because the
generated tables were correct while the prose around them was not.

Generated tables are protected by scripts/render_readme.py. Prose is protected
by this file. A claim that appears in neither is a claim nobody is checking.
